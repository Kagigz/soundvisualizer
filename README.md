## Customizable sound visualizer made with Unity

=> Watch the [video](https://youtu.be/AVSZH8UPU4I)

Includes a sound visualizer, a color picker and a music player, as well as controls to change the looks of the sound visualizer.

### Sound Visualizer

The script _AudioData.cs_ analyzes the sound and provides data, used by the script _DisplayFreq.cs_.

There are also UI controls (sliders) that can change the aspect of the sound visualizer.

### Color Picker

The script _ChangeColor.cs_ is a ready-to-use color picker (the palette I used is in the _Resources_ folder).

### Music Player

The script _SoundControls.cs_ is a music player, that can be used with UI controls : a play/pause button, and a slider (with values from 0 to 100). 

You can use the assets in this project for the play/pause button.

## How to use

Download or clone this repo, change the music if you want (in the _Music_ folder), and build the project for the target platform (standalone application for Windows/Mac/Linux).
